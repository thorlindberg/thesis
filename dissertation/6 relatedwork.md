{"chp":"Related Work"}

In this chapter I present existing research and projects that explore a problem area similar to mine. This previous and related work will act as both a source of inspiration for the development of my own proposal and evaluation of my results, and also as perspective on how to approach and propose evolution of the JSON format. By applying the learnings derived from previous work and experiences in my experiment, I aim to avoid constructing a proposal that is incompatible with existing computer systems or developing without consideration for users.

The JSON specification was an obvious choice for my project, as it has widespread use in software application development. However it is worth including work that compares and contrasts it with other similar formats such as YAML and XML, to illustrate their differences and advantages or disadvantages. Without this comparison, my experiment could result in a proposal for an already existing alternative. This is presented in the section on ["Specification of Data Serialisation Formats"](#specificationofdataserialisationformats).

The problem presented in this project can be solved in many different ways and at different levels. For this reason I include previous work towards extending the JSON syntax. By searching publicly accessible repositories on GitHub, I have found projects that worked towards extending the format with more explicit and type-safe syntax features. These projects are presented in the section on ["Attempts at Extensibility of Data Syntax"](#attemptsatextensibilityofdatasyntax).
