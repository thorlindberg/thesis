{"chp":"Related Work"}

In this chapter I present existing research and projects that explore a problem area similar to mine. This previous and related work will act as both a source of inspiration for the development of my own proposal and evaluation of my results, and also as perspective on how to approach and propose evolution of the JSON format. By applying the learnings derived from previous work and experiences in my experiment, I aim to avoid constructing a proposal that is incompatible with existing computer systems or developing without consideration for users.
