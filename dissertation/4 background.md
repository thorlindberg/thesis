{"sec":"Background"}

In this project I've chosen to collaborate with a company that specialises in native mobile application development. Their identity is kept anonymous, so rather than include confidential data or code samples, I have chosen to derive generic examples from the material they have provided me.

This company holds a unique perspective relative to the landscape of software development in Copenhagen, where return on investment (ROI) in my optics is valued above quality. Rather than take the typical multi-platform approach, using a platform-neutral framework like _React Native_, they maintain independent development teams for each platform, and they work exclusively with native code. They maintain an Android team utilising _Flutter_ and an iOS team utilising _Swift_. This nets them hardware efficiency and performance advantages, at the cost of operating and aligning two parallel developer teams working on the same projects.

In the following I illustrate the relationship between this company (_development company_) and their partners. This serves as a starting point for deducing which perspectives are held on working with data.
