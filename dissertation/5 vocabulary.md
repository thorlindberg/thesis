{"chp":"Vocabulary"}

In this chapter I present a vocabulary of concepts from the fields of computer and information science. These concepts will be applied in the development of my proposal and the interpretation of its results. It covers the fundamental principles of data, distributed computing, and test-driven development. Understanding data requires a framework for its representations, storage, transmission and processing. Understanding distributed computing requires a presentation of its layers and the software stack. Understanding test-driven development requires an explanation of its approaches to writing tests and demonstrating flaws or validating successes in a system.
