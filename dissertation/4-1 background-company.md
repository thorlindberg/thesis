{"sec":"Collaboration and Case Description"}

In this section I present my collaboration with the company and the specific case from which I source data samples and other material. As the company is kept anonymous, I present generic examples of data structures rather than confidential data samples.

{"sub":"Client project and case"}

In my collaboration with the contracted company I am only involved with the engineering department, who are responsible for software development and coordinating backend engineering with the client. The deliverables to this client are: `project management` `iOS/Android development` `backend development` and `UI/UX design`. This case is typical as its deliverables occur frequently across all published cases. 

Their client for this case provides both physical infrastructure and back-end maintenance for their product, but have contracted the company to develop a mobile application connecting users with the data from physical installed charging stations. The client collects and stores the status of their products (e.g. charge state), and they track availability of their proprietary chargers to offer users a map of available chargers.

As the client relies so heavily on connecting users with their data, the software developed also primarily relies on data interchange. The company and I have agreed to produce a proposal for an improved data structure that reduces the risk of misinterpretation, by investigating the current data validation processes and how mismatching data is handled in their systems and software stack.
