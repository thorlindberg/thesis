The `docs` property requires no input parameters and returns a String documenting the intended use of my library. This approach ensures that the code is documented as it is written, but it exists only at the top-level of the library rather than in individual components.

```
docs: [

    "How to validate with TXON",
    ∙∙∙
    
].join("\n")
```
