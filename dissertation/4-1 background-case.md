As seen in {"ref":"organisation"}, there are two identifiable hierarchies that form a relationship between case partner and development. The top half of this diagram flows from partner to a formulated case. The bottom half of this diagram flows from developer to a product delivery.

The structure of the partner company informs how they formulate the case offered to the developers. They are also responsible for maintenance of a back-end, delivering customer data to the client developed in the delivery.

The structure of the development company informs how they plan and execute on a case. They are not responsible for the back-end, and thus have to negotiate infrastructure plans and changes with their partners. This presents challenges to their autonomy, hierarchy and responsibilities.
