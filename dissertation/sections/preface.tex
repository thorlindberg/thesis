{\textbf{\textit{Abstract--}}Object-oriented programming allows developers to logically segment code, but as data is transmitted between languages and distributed across heterogeneous systems, these objects need to be serialised and deserialised. Heterogeneity creates a multitude of potential validation conflicts, as data formats must balance human readability with integrity. This report builds on existing research into data formats for object serialisation, by suggesting a trans-compilation compatibility layer on the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, designed for extensibility.} \\
