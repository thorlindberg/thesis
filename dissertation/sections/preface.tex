{\textbf{\textit{Abstract--}Data transmission in a heterogeneous distributed computing environment necessitates data serialisation. Human-readable and binary serialisation formats offer varying and interdependent balances between usability and type safety. This report evaluates the tradeoffs between formats through implementation in mobile software architecture. Related research focuses on format features and performance, while this report emphasises usability inherent to the format and usability as a cause of its implementation.}} \\
