{\textbf{\textit{Abstract--}}Data transmission across a heterogeneous system necessitates object serialisation and deserialisation. Developers choose between plaintext and binary formats, or a full stack implementation to homogenise their system. This report builds on existing research into object serialisation performance and efficiency, comparing object serialisation formats by modelling software architectures and assessing their usability.} \\
