In this project I've chosen to collaborate with a company that specialises in native mobile application development. Their identity is kept anonymous, so rather than include confidential data or code samples, I have chosen to derive generic examples from the material they have provided me.

This company holds a unique perspective relative to the landscape of software development in Copenhagen, where return on investment (ROI) in my optics is valued above quality. Rather than take the typical multi-platform approach, using a platform-neutral framework like React Native, they maintain independent development teams for each platform, and they work exclusively with native code. In practice they maintain an Android team utilising Flutter, and an iOS team utilising Swift. This results in efficiency and performance advantages, at the cost of operating and aligning two parallel teams rather than one.
