{"sub":"Target Audience"}

I characterise the intended reader of this report, by presenting the knowledge and experience that an ideal reader would have from my perspective. This characterisation is included to provide a baseline for what I expect from the reader, and the target audience this report was written to accomodate.

An ideal reader would have an educational background (either degree or current program) in Information Technology, Computer Science, or equivalent experience. This should provide them with an understanding of various data formats, most importantly the difference in application between plain-text and binary data. Additionally they should understand matrices, relational data, and object-oriented programming. Experience with statically and strongly-typed programming languages, and an understanding of how type-checking guides developers while they write, would be ideal but not expected.
