{"sec":"Proposal for Type-Extensible Notation"}

In the following section I present my proposal for a data interchange format, motivated and informed by these current conditions in the field of software development. This does not include an exhaustive implementation in a distributed system, but rather illustrates and argues for a data object notation that is both safer and easier to use.

In this section I introduce my proposal for the notation and syntax of a strongly- and extensibly-typed data interchange format, as documented with this report. This format is the result of a process involving exploration of the field and development in collaboration with software developers.
