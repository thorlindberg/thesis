{"sec":"Syntax Proposal"}

In this section I present my syntax proposal for extensibly typed JSON data structures. A proposal for changes to syntax or grammatical features of a programming language is typically structured as an argument for the conditions that necessitate the proposed change. This includes samples of code that demonstrate the flaws of the current implementation, the proposal applied as a solution in a real-world scenario, and design considerations for both the impact of the proposed change and alternative solutions to the issue.
