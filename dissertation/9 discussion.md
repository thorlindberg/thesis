{"chp":"Discussion"}

In this chapter I discuss the results of my experiment and the evaluation of my implementation. As I have already compared the implementation of TXON validation to the implementation of TypeScript validation, I instead focus on my methodological approach in comparison to the vocabulary and related work I presented in this report. I also present my reflections on the process and its outcome, by illustrating the alternative implementations I could have pursued, or how my implementation can be built upon from here.
