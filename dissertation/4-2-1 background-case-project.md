{"sub":"Client project and case"}

In my collaboration with the contracted company I am only involved with the engineering department, who are responsible for software development and coordinating backend engineering with the client. The deliverables for this client are: project management, iOS/Android development, backend development, and UI/UX design. This case is typical as its deliverables occur frequently across all published cases. 

Their client for this case provides both physical infrastructure and back-end maintenance for their product, but have contracted the company to develop a mobile application connecting users with their data. The client collects and stores the status of their products (e.g. charge state), and they track availability of their proprietary chargers to offer users a map of available chargers.

As the client relies so heavily on connecting users with their data, the software developed also primarily relies on data interchange. The company and I have agreed to produce a proposal for an improved data structure that guards against potential errors, by investigating the current data validation processes and how errors are handled in their systems and software architecture.
