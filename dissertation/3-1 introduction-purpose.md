{"sec":"Purpose of this Project"}

The contribution of this paper is an exploration into the balance between readability and safety in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), in order to propose a derived extensible format informed by the value perspective of developers. This proposed format, conceptualised as the Type-Extensible Object Notation (TXON), is paired with a translation layer written in JavaScript, to provide full compatibility with JSON data and language parsers. TXON aims to offer both a human-readable yet safe and extensible format, as well as extensible types in the data.
