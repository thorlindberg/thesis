{"sec":"Comparison of JSON and TXON"}

In this section I present an evaluation of the implemented syntax through the `txon.js library`. It is evaluated on its ability to substitute TypeScript validation and extensibly add explicit types to a JSON structure with minimal transformation of its existing data. The results presented here are not part of the syntax proposal, but they support the argument for its current implementation. As such it is crucial to preface these results by reiterating that this is not a final evaluation, and the current implementation is intended as a topic of discussion and initial iteration of an eventual final proposal.
