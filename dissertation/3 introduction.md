{"chp":"Introduction"}

As the prevalence of smartphones and internet of things (IoT) devices increasingly dictate the human experience, the software industry has pivoted towards connectivity-centered development. The common mobile software application is fully reliant on an internet connection, acting almost exclusively as a recipient (client) for transmitted data. These clients typically serve purposes such as social media communication, content consumption, user account access etc.

This reliance on connectivity means the software becomes a front-end client in a distributed computing system, with the logistical and computational responsibilities assigned and distributed to and among a network of devices. With this reality comes a series of architectural considerations and decisions that inform how and to what extent the front-end software is designed, developed and maintained.

A main feature of distributed systems is their ability to handle hardware and software heterogeneity, as information must travel digitally and physically across layers of applications, networks, and hardware. Heterogeneity manifests as differences in protocols, programming language features, and data formats. Heterogeneous systems must have the ability to transmit and parse information across layers, despite these differences. As data transmission has become ubiquitous, it is a great starting point for designing new software. The [vocabulary section](#vocabulary) explores the landscape of distribution and data transmission in-depth, establishing a vocabulary of terminology used for analysing and discussing the results of this project's experiment.

Existing research predominantly evaluates data serialisation formats from a feature, performance, and efficiency perspective. While these aspects are quantifiable, measurable, and potentially motivate decisions for designing large-scale data transmission systems, they fail to illustrate the conditions that inform the choice of data format for the common software development team. As performance differences are negligible, these conditions are likely more abstract and extend beyond development into the organisational structures and division of responsibilities in the team and between levels of developers.
