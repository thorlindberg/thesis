{"chp":"Introduction"}

With the rise in popularity of smartphones and internet-of-things (IOT) devices for communication, the internet and transmission of data across it has become a core focus for the software industry. The modern mobile software application is reliant on a continuous internet connection, and acts as a client for receiving and presenting information to its users. As is explored in this report, these clients can connect authenticated users with businesses and services, providing users with situational information about the products they use.

This evolution in computing has implications for how software is planned, developed and maintained. As the server becomes the predominant source of both information and computation, the software becomes more generic in structure so that it is more flexible to server-driven changes. In the field of mobile software application development, publishing approval and user installation consent is required before changes can be made to the software. As a result this software is heavily tested and guarded against hypothetical errors, which further encourages development of more generic software, as a rigid structure cannot be remotely, easily or quickly changed.

The data transmitted to these applications is often simple data structures containing small amounts of information, with a high frequency of transmission. Transmission occurs across layers in a system, referred to as a distributed system due to the distributed nature of communication. A main feature of distributed systems is their ability to handle hardware and software heterogeneity, as information must travel digitally and physically across layers of applications, networks, and hardware. Heterogeneity manifests as differences in protocols, programming language features, and data formats.

When transmitted data is received, it is validated as part of the guarding against hypothetical errors in the software. This is especially pronounced in a distributed system, because there can be multiple heterogeneous layers before the data reaches the software application. As is explored in this report, the implication is that multiple teams of developers must independently verify an intermediary data interchange format. The consequence is that each team has the risk of needing to debug an invalid data structure, which can be an unexpected and expensive resource investment.

In this chapter I introduce the problem area that I have selected, and my plan for how to address the issues currently faced when utilising data interchange formats as intermediaries in software development. This report is phrased as a proposal for an implementation, and is intended as a topic of discussion rather than a quantitive measure of certain conditions. As such the intent with this report is to ignite and inspire further interest in this field, and more specifically in how to support developers when debugging their data structures.
