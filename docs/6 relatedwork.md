{"sec":"Related Work"}

In this section I present academic literature and projects that inspired my theoretical and methodological framework for approaching this project. As this project proposes extensibility of a data interchange format surrounded with well-established practices and rigid structures, it is crucial that my approach be informed by existing and previous work. By presenting these references and applying their methods in my experiment, I aim to avoid constructing a proposal that is incompatible with existing systems or derived without consideration for user perspectives.

HOW I CAME TO MY FRAMEWORK

Let's start by deliminating the contents of this framework.

It consists of theory on how to methodologically approach writing tests in a test-driven development process,

projects that attempt to extend the JSON syntax with type declarations for specific programming languages,

and strategies for choosing and evaluating data syntax and the implementation of data formats in computer systems.
