<b><i>Abstractâ€”</i></b>Object-oriented programming allows developers to logically segment code, but as data is transmitted between languages and distributed across heterogeneous systems, these objects need to be serialised and deserialised. Heterogeneity creates a multitude of potential validation conflicts, as data formats must balance human readability with safety. This report builds on existing research into data formats for object serialisation, by suggesting an extensible syntax on top of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), with an additional backwards-compatibility layer.
