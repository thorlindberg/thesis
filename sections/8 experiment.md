{"sec":"Experiment Setup"}

This section presents the conditions defined to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed superset JSON format. I provide examples of data, code and infrastructure necessary to construct an environment wherein the TXON syntax and features can be tested.

The success of this experiment is measured by the reduction in lines of code necessary in guarding data validity through defensive mechanisms. The criteria for success with this project is a reduction of at least 10%.

The examples presented in this section represent fetched temperature measurements. This decision was taken because weather data has direction, spatial/geographical localisation, and various representational states, in addition to general relevance for server-driven applications.
