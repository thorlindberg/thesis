{"cite":"eriksson2011comparison"} compares the syntax and performance of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) formats for structuring data in plain text. These light-weight data interchange formats aim to structure information with minimal additional data, such as tags or type/requirement specifications. Their purpose is to increase human-readability and ease-of-use for both authors and interpreters, and the intended use is transmission of data with non-critical requirements.
